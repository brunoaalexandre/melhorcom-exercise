# About this project

This project was made for the Melhor Celular store. <br /><br />
It's a simple project where the user can register the cell phones he is selling in his store. Can also edit it later, or remove it when sell it. <br/><br />
In the project I found some challenges, like make doing some validations when registering cell phones.<br /> <br />
So, that's all, folks! ‚ù§Ô∏è
